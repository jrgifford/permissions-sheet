##Permissions App.

So, hello!

You might be wondering what this is. Well, you'd be right to wonder. This is, to put it simply, a simple application that I wrote to fulfill the following requirements:

- Runs on WebOS (that's what phone I got).

- Be useful.

- Be built using PhoneGap, since I've never played with PhoneGap.

So to fulfill the first one, I built using PhoneGap, which fulfilled the third.

Now how do we fulfill the second? Well, I sometimes have a hard time remembering permissions, so I created this cheat sheet with my personal favorites.
